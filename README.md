# Federeichon

### *This project is aiming to solve two main problems that (ussually) Universities' Federations have:*

1. *The first one is lack of communication with the students. This could be because they might not know how to do this efficiently or because the University doesn't grant them permition to do so.*
2. *The second one is the surveying and voting systems that they have, which sometimes could be awfull, old and non-representative.*

* **Possible clients:**
  * Any Students Federation from all over the world
* **Main objective:**
  * Develop an aplication for spreading information among the students, encouraging them to participate in crucial decisions through voting and polling and creating new spaces for opinion and descussion with forums.
* **All the documentation is in the following link: https://github.com/joadr/federeichon/blob/master/docs/**
